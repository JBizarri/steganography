# How to contribute

First things first, thank for taking the time to read this because we every little bit of help is appreciated. üòÅ

This is project is really simple (and not inovative at all üòÖ) and is being developed for fun on my free time only, as of consequence is not intented to be complex or extensive.

All the usage is on the [README](https://github.com/JBizarri/steganography/blob/master/README.md) file.

## Testing

We have a PyTest as our testing framework. All tests are inside the `tests` folder and we use the same structure as the main code for easily finding where the tested file is.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Steganography](https://github.com/JBizarri/steganography/compare) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include tests for new features. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using four spaces
  * We follow PEP8 naming convetion
  * We use Black (default settings) to format our code
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.

And again, thank your being interested in Steganography. ‚ù§
